title: Week 1 - September 19th to September 23rd

With the first week of Metis in the books, I thought it would be useful to share my experience so far. I had decided to do a Data Science bootcamp in late August so for my prep work I only had three weeks. However, I have taken one programming course before at Carnegie Mellon University so working in Python is somewhat comfortable. 

On the first day of the bootcamp we got right into lectures and learning. We began with a Pair Programming problem where we are randomly assigned to one other person in our cohort. Once we finished the pair programming assignment, lectures began with Git, Pandas, and we were already beginning our challenge. 

The challenege consisted mostly of Data Munging and working with data from the MTA. I learned fairly quickly that the hardest part about any data science project is making sure the data is easily manipulated and cleaned. At Metis, you are thrown immediately into your project and expecting to use Pandas immediately. 

The next days were focused around more Pandas, working through a data munging challenge, and a lot more on the project of analyzing the MTA data. 

Overall, the first week shows how much information there is to digest for data science. There are a lot of different specialities in data science to focus on, and we are only getting started.
